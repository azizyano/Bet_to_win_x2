#### A note on MetaMask and web3-react

Harmony isn't currently compatible with MetaMask. There's also nothing similar to [web3-react](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/web3-react) right now.

Harmony is looking into both MetaMask support as well as creating a web3-react component compatible with OneWallet and MathWallet.

Depending on when you read this, this tools might (or might not) have been implemented.

#### Development & deployment

The UI resides in the [ui](ui/) folder, so `cd ui`Â before running the commands below.

To start the UI on http://localhost:3000, just run `yarn start`.

To create a production build, run `yarn build`.
